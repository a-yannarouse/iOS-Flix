# iOS 101: Lab - Week 7 - Flix Detail (TableView + Navigation)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

By the end of this lab I was able to...

- Handle table view cell selection  
- Implement push navigation  
- Pass data to another view controller using segues  
- Use `prepare(for:sender:)` to pass data  
- Display detailed information in a secondary view  
- Customize and polish a detail screen UI  

## ðŸš€ Features

### âœ… Required Features

- Tap on a movie cell to navigate to a detail screen  
- Add a new view controller for the detail screen in storyboard  
- Use a segue with the "Show" style to navigate between view controllers  
- Create and link a `DetailViewController` class to the detail screen  
- Add UI elements (poster, backdrop, title, overview, vote average, release date)  
- Pass movie data to the detail view using the `prepare(for:sender:)` method  
- Configure the detail UI using passed movie data and `Nuke` to load images  
- Enable large titles for the feed view and small titles for the detail view  
- Deselect table cell on return to feed view

## ðŸ›  Notes

- The project builds on the previous movie feed lab  
- UI polish included adjusting image view content modes, font styles, and navigation titles  
- The `movie` property in `DetailViewController` uses `!` because itâ€™s guaranteed to be set before the detail screen loads  
- I only edited the parts of the code marked for customization  
- This lab helped reinforce how to create multi-screen apps using storyboards, segues, and view controller communication in Swift
